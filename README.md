# Wc

## Description
Super tiny project which unique objective is to practice a bit with some basic rust.
For this purpose, I've chosen to emulate wc bash library.
## Running the code

```bash
$ cargo run -- <arg_type>
## Where arg_type is one of the wc variations.
## -l to count lines
## -w to count words
## -c to count characterss

# Also accepts files as arguments like the original tool.
## cargo run -- -l README.md
```
